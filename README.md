Welcome to Ruby!

## Setup

* Check out the git repository

        git clone git://github.com/blazingcloud/ruby_lessons.git

* Install RSpec

        gem install rspec

* Configure RSpec (optional). If you're running a bash shell, you can put the following in your .bash_profile to make the output a bit nicer.

        alias rspec="rspec --color --format nested"

* For lesson 14

        gem install fakeweb

###When you have a question...

First, search for the answer (keywords, exact error string)

*	Google
*	http://www.ruby-forum.com 
*	http://stackoverflow.com/ 

If you didn’t find the answer and you need to ask your question:

1. Include version numbers:
    $ ruby -v
    ruby 1.8.6 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 287) \[universal-darwin9.0\]
2. Note where you have already looked for an answer
3. If you can, include code snippets that reproduce the problem in isolation
